        <p>Act No. 43 of 1994</p>
        <p>Preamble—</p>
        <p>An Act to provide for reservation of seats in educational institutions in the State of Karnataka and of appointments or posts in the services under the State for the Other Backward Classes of citizens and for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the State.</p>
        <p>WHEREAS the policy of reservation for the social and educational advancement of the people belonging to Backward Classes of citizens in admission to educational institutions in the State and for appointments in the services under the State has been under implementation in the State for a long time;</p>
        <p>And whereas, clause (4) of Article 15 of the Constitution enables the State to make any special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally Backward Classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes;</p>
        <p>And whereas, clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution enables the State to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any Backward Classes of citizens which in the opinion of the State is not adequately represented in the services under the State;</p>
        <p>And whereas, clause (1) of Article 38 of the Constitution, the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life;</p>
        <p>And whereas under clause (2) of Article 38 of the Constitution, the State shall, in particular, strive to minimise the inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations;</p>
        <p>And whereas under clause (b) of Article 39 of the Constitution the State shall in particular, direct its policy towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good;</p>
        <p>And whereas under clause (c) of article 39 of the Constitution the State shall in particular direct the policy towards securing that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment;</p>
        <p>And whereas under Article 46 of the Constitution, the State shall promote, with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation;</p>
        <p>And whereas the Karnataka Third Backward Classes Commission has submitted its report taking into account all available information in regard to social and educational backwardness of the backward communities, castes and tribes and considering the level of poverty of each community their way of life, standard of living, habits and customs, place of each community in social hierarchy and the State Government, has taken into consideration of such report and the guidelines given by the Supreme Court of India in the Judgement of Vasanth Kumar and another Vs. State of Karnataka and the Judgement delivered on 16.11.1992, relating to reservation for socially and educationally Backward Classes in particular on the implementation of Mandal Commission Report in Indira Sawhaney Vs. Union of India (AIR 1993 SC 477);</p>
        <p>And whereas in the opinion of the State Government, Backward Classes of citizens and the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled tribes who constitute the majority of the total population of the State are not adequately represented in the services under the State in proportion to their population in the State of Karnataka;</p>
        <p>And whereas the State government after careful consideration of the above factors have taken a policy decision that the existing level of seventy three per cent reservation in admission to educational institutions in the State and in the services under the State for the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes of citizens be raised to eighty per cent for ensuring the advancement of the aforesaid Classes in the State;</p>
