        <p>Act XLII of 1983</p>
        <p>An Act to regulate location of market areas and wholesale markets in respect of specified commodities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and to established market committees to manage and control different markets established in different market areas for different commodities and to provide for matters connected therewith or supplemental or incidental thereto.</p>
        <p>WHEREAS, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has been established under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974 for the purpose of planning, co-ordinating and supervising the proper, orderly and rapid development of the areas in the Bombay Metropolitan Region;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS, with the fast growth of population and commercial activities, the congestion and consequent traffic, accommodation and other problems in Brihan Mumbai and particularly in South Mumbai have been increasing enormously and therefore the State Government has accepted the policy to decongest the old island City and to shift as many commercial activities as possible to place outside South Mumbai for achieving the objectives for which the Metropolitan Authority is established;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS, with a view to relieving some of the congestion, steps are being taken under the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1963, to shift wholesale markets for some of the agricultural produce like onions and potatoes to Navi Mumbai;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS, necessity is increasingly felt to locate or relocate wholesale markets for some of the non-agricultural products also like textile and iron and steel immediately and for other commodities as soon as possible;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS, at present there is no provision of law available to enable the State Government, the Metropolitan Authority or any local authority to take any appropriate steps for establishing or shifting such markets to other localities;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS, it is therefore, necessary to enact a law immediately to regulate the location of market areas and wholesale markets in respect of commodities specified, from time to time, under such law and establish market committees to manage and control different markets established for different commodities in different market areas and to provide for matters connected therewith or supplemental or incidental thereto; it is hereby enacted in the Thirty-fourth year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p>
