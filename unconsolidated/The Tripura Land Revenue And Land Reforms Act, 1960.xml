Where  a tenancy is sought to be terminated on the ground that the  underraiyat has materially impaired the value or utility of the land  for agricultural purposes, if the damage to the land admits of being  repaired or if pecuniary compensation would afford adequate relief, no  proceeding for eviction shall lie against the under- raiyat unless and  until the raiyat has served on the under- raiyat a notice in writing  specifying the damage complained of and the under- raiyat has failed  within a period of one year from the service of such notice to repair  the damage or to pay compensation therefor.</heading>
