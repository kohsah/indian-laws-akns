        <p>An Act to supplement the Madras Prohibition Act, 1937</p>
        <p>Whereas in Criminal Revision Cases Numbers 1052, 1053 and 1054 of 1940 on its file, the High Court of Judicature at Madras has decided that section 4 (1) (a) of the Madras Prohibition Act, 1937 (Madras Act X of 1937), in so far as it relates to dangerous drugs, a matter included in the Concurrent Legislative List in the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, is repugnant to the provisions of an existing Indian law on such matter, namely, the Madras Abkari Act, 1886 (Madras Act I of 1886), and the rules made thereunder, and is consequently void by reason of the fact that the said Prohibition Act was not reserved for the consideration of the Governor-general or for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure as required by subsection (2) of section 107 of the said Government of India Act;</p>
        <p>And whereas it is necessary to rectify the defect disclosed by the judgment of the High Court in the cases referred to above;</p>
        <p>And whereas it is also necessary to protect the State Government, officers of the Central or State Government, and authorities and persons acting under the orders of the State Government or of such officers, from liability in respect of anything in good faith ordered or done or purporting to have been ordered or done under the provisions of the said Prohibition Act;</p>
        <p>It is hereby enacted as follows:</p>
