            <p>Provided that where an assessment under sub-section (3) of section 16 or this section has been made, for the relevant assessment year, no action shall be taken under this section after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless any net wealth chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for such assessment year by reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to make a return under section14 or section 15 or in response to a notice issued under sub-section (4) of section 16 or this section or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that assessment year:</p>

            <p>Provided also that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply in a case where any net wealth in relation to any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India chargeable to tax, has escaped assessment for any assessment year:</p>

            <p>The Settlement Commission may, if it is satisfied that any person who made the application for settlement under section 22C has co-operated with the Settlement Commission in the proceedings before it and has made a full and true disclosure of his net wealth and the manner in which such wealth has been acquired, grant to such person, subject to such conditions as it may think fit to impose, immunity from prosecution for any offence under this Act or under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or under any other Central Act for the time being in force and also (either wholly or in part) from the imposition of any penalty under this Act, with respect to the case covered by the settlement:</p>
            <p>Provided that no such immunity shall be granted by the Settlement Commission in cases where the proceedings for the prosecution for any such offence have been instituted before the date of receipt of the application under section 22C.</p>
            <p>Provided further that the Settlement Commission shall not grant immunity from prosecution for any offence under the Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860) or under any Central Act other than this Act and Income-tax Act, 1961(43 of 1961) to a person who makes an application under section 22C on or after the 1st day of June, 2007.</p>

            <p>An immunity granted to a person under sub-section (1) shall stand withdrawn if such person fails to pay any sum specified in the order of settlement passed under sub-section (4) of section 22D within the time specified in such order or within such further time as may be allowed by the Settlement Commission, or fails to comply with any other condition subject to which the immunity was granted and thereupon the provisions of this Act shall apply as if such immunity had not been granted.</p>

            <p>An immunity granted to a person under sub-section (1) may, at any time, be withdrawn by the Settlement Commission, if it is satisfied that such person had, in the course of the settlement proceedings, concealed any particulars material to the settlement or had given false evidence, and thereupon such person may be tried for the offence with respect to which the immunity was granted or for any other offence of which he appears to have been guilty in connection with the settlement and shall also become liable to the imposition of any penalty under this Act to which such person would have been liable, had no such immunity been granted.</p>
