      <p>An Act to Prevent Malpractices and Unfair Means at or relating to Public Examinations and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.</p>
      <p>Whereas, the laws in force in the State of Telangana relating to the educational system are found to be inadequate to control or eradicate effectively organised malpractices in relation to public examinations on the part of the persons with vested interests operating individually or collectively by unlawful means for unlawful considerations;</p>
      <p>And whereas, the vast majority of meritorious examinees are adversely affected by such unlawful activity which is disrupting the examination system;</p>
      <p>And whereas, it is also necessary to curb false and misleading advertisements and other modes of publicity intended to induce students to seek admission into various educational institutions or tutorial institutions</p>
      <p>Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Andhra Pradesh in the Forty-eighth Year of the Republic of India, as follows:-</p>
