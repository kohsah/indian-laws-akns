      <p>An Act to provide relief from indebtedness to certain farmers, rural artisans, rural labourers and workers.</p>
      <p>WHEREAS, both Houses of the State Legislature were not in session;</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS the Governor of Maharashtra was satisfied that circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for him to take immediate action to provide for relief from indebtedness to certain farmers, rural artisans, rural labourers and workers in the State of Maharashtra; and for that purpose promulgated the Maharashtra Debt Relief Ordinance, 1975, on 22nd day of August 1975;</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS, it is now considered that relief from indebtedness should be restricted to liabilities arising out of loans only and debts of workers who hold immovable property the market value of which does not exceed twenty thousand rupees should stand liquidated, and the debts of workers who hold such property the market value of which exceeds twenty thousand rupees but does not exceed forty thousand rupees should receive moratorium for a temporary period;</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS it is expedient to replace the said Ordinance by an Act of the State Legislature after carrying out there in the amendments as hereinafter provided for securing the above purposes and other purposes hereinafter appearing;</p>
      <p>It is hereby enacted in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:—</p>
