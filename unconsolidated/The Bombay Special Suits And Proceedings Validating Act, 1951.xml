        <p>Act No. 15 of 1951</p>
        <p>An Act to validate special jurisdiction suits and proceedings in the State of Bombay.</p>
        <p>WHEREAS by Government Notification, Home Department, No. 2346/5, dated the 20th January 1950, the State Government invested the Bombay City Civil Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of certain suits and proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees in value and arising in Greater Bombay;</p>
        <p>WHEREAS in Original Civil Jurisdiction Suit No. 240 of 1950, the Bombay High Court held that the said notification was invalid and of no effect;</p>
        <p>WHEREAS in Civil Appeal No. 10 of 1950 in its civil appellate jurisdiction the Supreme Court of India set aside the said decision of the Bombay High Court and held that the said notification was intra vires and legal;</p>
        <p>WHEREAS during the interval between the date of the said notification and the decision of the Supreme Court certain suits and proceedings of a civil nature have been instituted in the Bombay High Court and some of them have been tried and disposed of;</p>
        <p>AND WHEREAS it is necessary and expedient to validate the decrees and orders which have been passed in the said suits and proceedings and to provide for the return and presentation of those which have been dismissed or are pending to the City Court;</p>
